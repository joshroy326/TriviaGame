// need to create a start button for the user to hit and then the page will reveal the timer and the questions

// create a timer when the page loads so the user knows how much time he has left to answer the questions given


//need to create logic when the timer ends that the user is alerted that the time is up and that its time to check the answers


//need to make sure this is a way that the user only gets to answere one option


// when the timer ends the page will need to transition to a new window or section or some hidden content that will only show when the timer ends and will show the user how many answers hes gotten correct or incorrect
